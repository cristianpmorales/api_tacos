# api_tacos

## Things I learned

This is one of the first projects at Resilient Coders. We started to learn how to connect to an api. My chose was to connect to an API
that return a recipe for tacos. It is a simple API that only requires a button to call the API and return a recipe. It is very basic and 
no css was used
